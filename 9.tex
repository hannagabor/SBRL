\textbf{Chapter 9 solutions  \hfill Hanna GÃ¡bor}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Show that tabular methods such as presented in Part I of this book are a
    special case of linear function approximation. What would the feature vectors be?}
    
    The feature would be an indicator of the state: the feature vector's length would be
    equal to the number of states, and $x(s_i)$ would be a vector that contains $1$ at
    the $i^{th}$ coordinate and $0$ at the others. The weight vector would also have
    the same length as the number of states. The $i^th$ weight would be our value estimate
    for $s_i$. When we're doing the update, the gradient of $x(s_i)$ is $0$ everywhere except
    for coordinate $i$, where it's $1$, so we would only update the weight for the current state.
    
  \item \textit{Why does (9.17) define $(n + 1)^k$ distinct features for dimension $k$?}
    
    For each state $s_j$, we choose one of $n + 1$ options: $s_j^0, s_j^1 \dots, s_j^n$.
    There are $k$ states, we make a choice for each them: we can do that ($(n + 1)^k$)-many
    ways.

  \item \textit{What n and $c_{i,j}$ produce the feature vectors
    \[x(s) = (1, s_1, s_2, s_1s_2, s_1^2, s_2^2, s_1s_2^2, s_1^2s_2, s_1^2s_2^2)^T?\]}

    n &= 2 \\
    c_{1, 1} &= c_{1, 2} = 0\\
    c_{2, 1} &= 1, c_{2, 2} = 0\\
    c_{3, 1} &= 0, c_{3, 2} = 1\\
    c_{4, 1} &= 1, c_{4, 2} = 1\\
    c_{5, 1} &= 2, c_{5, 2} = 0\\
    c_{6, 1} &= 0, c_{6, 2} = 2\\
    c_{7, 1} &= 1, c_{7, 2} = 2\\
    c_{8, 1} &= 2, c_{8, 2} = 1\\
    c_{9, 1} &= 2, c_{9, 2} = 2\\
