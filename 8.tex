\textbf{Chapter 8 solutions  \hfill Hanna GÃ¡bor}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    \textit{The nonplanning method looks particularly poor in Figure 8.3 because it is
    a one-step method; a method using multi-step bootstrapping would do better. Do you
    think one of the multi-step bootstrapping methods from Chapter 7 could do as well as
    the Dyna method? Explain why or why not.}

    I think so. An $n$-step bootstrpping algorithm with big enough $n$ (or a Monte Carlo
    method) would update at the end of the first episode all the action-values we encountered
    during the episode.
    I expect the policy based on these updated action-values to be quite good.
